The Webster’s dictionary definition of balance is a state in which different things occur in equal or proper amounts or have an equal or proper amount of importance. Balance has always been my greatest weakness. I see the world in black and white, but life happens in the gray area. I think it makes me feel a lack of control. 

I had high hopes entering Flat Iron, that I would fly through school effortlessly and finish quickly. In past situations, I’ve often chosen the easiest path for myself, because it’s a comfortable feeling to know you don’t need to do much to excel. But I want more. I want the challenge. I want to prove myself, to myself. In order to make that happen, I’m going to need to embrace some gray area. I’m going to need to be uncomfortable. I’m going to need to accept that I won’t be the best or the worst (which would ordinarily mean washing my hands of the situation), but simply average. And I’ll probably struggle to achieve that. 

I’d like to make it clear, I’m struggling less with the curriculum and more (significantly more) with the platform. Also, life hit me when I started school, in fact right when I started school. My father fell ill, I started a new relationship, my jeep decided to fall apart, a dear friend took her life, I ended up with an abscessed tooth, my mother’s fiancée moved out overnight, my sister was assaulted, and my cat needed surgery, all in the span of two months. I’m not complaining. Life happens, and I can still find a lot to be grateful for. But nevertheless, these are distracting events. So, lack of focus, coupled with frustrations with the platform, have seriously impacted my motivation. And the realization that I’m not flying through the program with ease and won’t come close to hitting my 6-month goal, topped with a heavy load of “my brain is old and doesn’t willingly focus”, have me instinctually wanting to raise the white flag. 

**But I will not. **

This is where I need to accept that my goal is adjustable, the program is self-paced for a reason, and I WILL complete this program at the pace I am capable of, not the pace of Ada Lovelace or a Darwin award winner, but MY pace (the gray area). I feel a lot of pressure from outside sources including my girlfriend, friends and family, as well as my coaches and other students, and I am embarrassed to admit I’m not where I said I would be. But I’m not doing this for anyone other than myself. 

I recently made a post asking my friends and family for the kind of support I need while I’m in school: no questions about how school is going, no distractions during the school week, and tacos, because who doesn’t love tacos? It felt empowering to declare my needs publicly. This is step one for me being able to find balance in my life. Step two is setting myself up with a more achievable schedule that incorporates life and job into my study time requirements. Step three will be embracing that I did not enter school to compete in a race. Yes, every month costs more money, but it is an investment in my future. I don’t want to leave school the fastest, but more so a capable and educated programmer, regardless of how long that takes. 

And I believe this is the greatest balance challenge: defining the middle ground where you are completing your education in a timely manner, without sacrificing the quality of your education. In other words, at what pace do you sacrifice your ability to comprehend the material for a smaller school loan debt? But education is invaluable, and I’m not blind to the fact that I’m privileged to even have the opportunity, so I will get the very most out of this program. And hopefully, I learn more than just coding. Hopefully, I learn balance.
